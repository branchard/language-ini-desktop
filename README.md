# Syntax support for INI files in Atom[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fusion809/language-ini-desktop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fusion809/language-ini-desktop)

This package is a fork of the original [`language-ini`](https://github.com/jacobbednarz/atom-language-ini) package, with the main distinguishing characteristic between the two being this package provides better support for desktop configuration files. `language-ini` can be used to edit desktop configuration files and it is not overtly bad at this, but it would highlight everything that came after `;` the same, which can make it difficult to read `MimeType` and `Categories` fields in desktop files.

Contributions are welcome. Please fork and send a pull requests for updates to grammars, snippets or documentation.
